# js-library
For the <a href='https://www.theodinproject.com/paths/full-stack-ruby-on-rails/courses/javascript/lessons/library'>project</a> on TOP.

Notes:
I've realised now it would have been far more effective to just build my tiles BASED off the array, rather than building and maintaining both...

ALl up, not gonna lie, realised plenty of mistakes later on.. with biggest one being above. This is defintely brittle and would be hard to maintain and build upon ðŸ˜¬

First JS project ever tho, so gotta start somewhere. Next one will be better!

Needs to be:
<ul>
  <li>Organised a bit better, shorter functions, better naming</li>
  <li>More dependency injection(?), atm everythings pulling off everything else.. Makes it hard to touch anything!<li>
</ul>
